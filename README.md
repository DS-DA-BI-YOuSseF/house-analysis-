# 🏠 KC Housing Data Analysis

## 📋 Description
A data analysis project using **Python** to explore and predict house prices in the **King County (KC)** dataset.  
The goal is to identify the most important factors affecting house prices and build predictive models using machine learning.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Name:** KC House Data  
- **Rows:** ~21,000  
- **Main Columns:**
  - `price` — Selling price of the house  
  - `sqft_living` — Living area (square feet)  
  - `bedrooms` — Number of bedrooms  
  - `bathrooms` — Number of bathrooms  
  - `floors` — Number of floors  
  - `zipcode` — Location code  
  - `grade` — Overall house quality  
  - `sqft_lot` — Lot area

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Understand variable distributions  
   - Visualize relationships between features  
2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Remove outliers  
   - Fix data types  
3. **Correlation Analysis:**  
   - Identify most correlated features with price  
4. **Modeling:**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Tree Regressor  
   - K-Means Clustering (for property segmentation)  
5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

---

## 🚀 Results
- **sqft_living** was found to be the most influential feature in predicting house prices.  
- **Linear Regression** achieved an accuracy of around **68%**.  
- **K-Means** clustering successfully separated houses into distinct price-based groups.
